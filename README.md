## Find the first set of unique characters in a string

Given a string, find the first set of unique characters of a defined length in
the string. For example, the string "ababcabc" has the first set of 3 unique
characters as `Some("abc")`. The string "aabbcc" has no unique characters, so the output
should be `None`.

This is a leetcode problem that Primeagen talked about; I'm just quickly documenting the
solution here as a reference.
